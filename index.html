<p>Sabina was born in Nepal in 1987, entering the world as the second child of Biku Maya and Krishna Chandra. 
Growing up, she was immersed in the rich and vibrant traditions of her family's Newari culture. The sounds of festivals, the tastes of communal feasts, 
and the close-knit nature of her community in the Kathmandu Valley shaped her early years, instilling in her a deep sense of tradition and family. </p>

<p>Her formal education began at the Holi Garden School, where she first discovered her love for learning. As she grew, so did her ambition. 
After completing her secondary education, Sabina made a pivotal decision that would define her life: she pursued a career in nursing. 
She enrolled at the prestigious Maharajgunj Nursing Campus, where she completed her initial nursing studies. </p>

<p>In 2007, Sabina officially began her nursing career, stepping into the healthcare system of her home country with compassion and dedication. 
Eager to advance her knowledge, she later earned her Bachelor of Nursing from B&B Hospital. Over the following years, she honed her skills and gained 
invaluable experience serving patients across a variety of healthcare settings. She worked at Siddismriti Hospital, Bhaktapur Cancer Hospital, 
Civil Service Hospital, and several others, building a reputation as a skilled and empathetic nurse. </p>

<p>In 2015, Sabina's life took a significant turn when she migrated to Canada with her husband. Arriving in a new country presented a fresh set of 
challenges and opportunities. Determined to continue her calling, she enrolled at York University in January 2017 to pursue a Bachelor of 
Science in Nursing (BScN) as an upgrade to her international credentials. She began this rigorous program while seven months pregnant, demonstrating 
remarkable resolve from the very start. Just two months later, in March of that year, during her second-last semester, she gave birth to her first child, 
seamlessly balancing the demands of new motherhood with her intensive studies.</p>

<p>While juggling her studies and a young family, Sabina began working as a Practical Nurse in 2018. Her hard work and determination culminated in a 
remarkable achievement just before her final semester. She successfully passed her OSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Examination), 
the crucial licensing exam. This accomplishment allowed her to begin her career as a Registered Nurse even before formally graduating from York University. 
She started this new chapter of her nursing journey at Trillium Health Partners.</p>

<p>Never one to stop learning, Sabina enrolled in York University's Master of Science in Nursing (MScN) program in 2019, with a goal to become a 
Nurse Practitioner. Once again, she balanced work, life, and rigorous study, and in 2021, amidst her graduate studies, she welcomed her second child. 
She navigated the demands of a master's program and a growing family with grace and perseverance, graduating in 2022 as a Primary Healthcare Nurse Practitioner. </p>

<p>Since achieving her advanced degree, Sabina has been a vital healthcare provider, serving diverse patient populations in various Long-Term Care homes and 
Family Practice facilities across her community. Her journey—from the cultural heart of Nepal to the forefront of the Canadian healthcare system, while raising 
    a family—is a powerful testament to her perseverance, dedication to healing, and the lifelong pursuit of growth. </p>
